Demos span R Tools for VS, Python Tools for VS, and Azure Notebooks. Accompanying readme highlights salient points of the demo and useful talking points. Demos have been provided for most used scenarios (based on telemetry data) and new features that we might added in our latest releases. \n\nFor demos in the field, pick the demo appropriately covers the feature in context of scenario(s) most closely aligned with customers current needs and bent. For instance, there are two demos for the Cookiecutter Explorer feature; one utilizes the Azure Web Apps Cookiecutter template, while the other uses the IoT Hub/DocumentDB template. When demoing to a web development shop, Azure Web Apps one would be better pitch for the feature. \n\nIf you can't find a demo you are looking for or have discovered a new customer scenario you'd like a demo for, file an issue on [github](https://github.com/eclectir/Visual-Studio-Data-Science-Demos/issues/new).\n\n## Repo Structure\n\nVisualStudio-Data-Science-Demos \u00c2\u00a0 \n> Demo-Project \u00c2\u00a0 \n>> Project Files \u00c2\u00a0\n>> Solution File \u00c2\u00a0\n>> demo-pitch.md (Contains sales pitch, demo flow, and details for the demo) \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\n\n## Python Demos\n\nFeature | Scenario | Demo \n--- | --- | --- \nAnaconda Distro | Machine Learning using the VS Data Science Workload only | Predictive Analysis with Anaconda in PTVS\nRemote Debugging | Debug code running on a Linux VM from your IDE | Remote debugging code running on a Linux VM with PTVS\nCookiecutter Explorer | Developing apps from integrated templates | Creating an IoT Data Pipeline with Azure IoT hub and DocumentDB\nCode Cells | Work with .py file exported from a Jupyter notebook | CodeCells and REPL\nProfiling | Find bottlenecks in your machine learning service | Profiling a simple classification script\n\n\n## R Demos\n\n\n## F# Demos\n\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "nbformat": 4, "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.5.1", "name": "python", "file_extension": ".py", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}}
