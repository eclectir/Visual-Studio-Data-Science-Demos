# Visual-Studio-Data-Science-Demos
A repository ofÂ demo code and scenario information for storytelling. 

Examples/Demos in this repository are intended for new users, educators, and Microsoft field staff to learn about Visual Studio based data science tools and features. Demos span R Tools for VS, Python Tools for VS, and Azure Notebooks. Accompanying readme highlights salient points of the demo and useful talking points. Demos have been provided for most used scenarios (based on telemetry data) and new features that we might added in our latest releases.
