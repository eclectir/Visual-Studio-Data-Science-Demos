# Visual-Studio-Data-Science-Demos
A repository ofÂ demo code and scenario information for storytelling. 

Examples/Demos in this repository are intended for new users, educators, and Microsoft field staff to learn about Visual Studio based data science tools and features. Demos span R Tools for VS, Python Tools for VS, and Azure Notebooks. Accompanying readme highlights salient points of the demo and useful talking points. Demos have been provided for most used scenarios (based on telemetry data) and new features that we might added in our latest releases. 

For demos in the field, pick the demo appropriately covers the feature in context of scenario(s) most closely aligned with customers current needs and bent. For instance, there are two demos for the Cookiecutter Explorer feature; one utilizes the Azure Web Apps Cookiecutter template, while the other uses the IoT Hub/DocumentDB template. When demoing to a web development shop, Azure Web Apps one would be better pitch for the feature. If you can't find a demo you are looking for or have discovered a new customer scenario you'd like a demo for, shoot an email to uanwer@microsoft.com
